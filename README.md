- 👋 Hi, I’m @Uboatwaffe
- 👀 I’m interested in programing as you might already guessed!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, C++ and Python
- 💡 I know also SQL, HTML and CSS but i do not spend my time using these languages now
- 💞 My main programing language is Java (which I love)
- 👨‍💻 I'm mostly proud of repository BubbleSort

Just because I'm an IT guy doesn't mean I can fix your printer, I mean I can, but not because I'm an IT guy 😜
