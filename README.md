- 👋 Hi, I’m @Uboatwaffe
- 👀 I’m interested in programing as you might have already guessed!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and C++
- 💡 I know also SQL (sometimes with Java), HTML, CSS and Python (all to basic level) but i do not spend my time using these languages now
- 💞 My main programing language is Java (which I love)
- 👨‍💻 I'm mostly proud of repository 'Quiz'
